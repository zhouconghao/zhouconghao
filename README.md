<h1> Hi! Zhou here! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>


Welcome to my GitHub page where I store my code! 

I am a physics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. 

More info about me can be found at [zch.info](http://www.zch.info).

## Projects

Currently, I am splitting my time between these projects:
```
 Develop a method for improving optical cluster cosmology with multi-wavelength data.

 Study the spatial distribution of stellar particles with IllustrisTNG.

 Measure the shear response clustering bias in cosmic shear.
```
