<h1> Hi! Zhou here! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>


Welcome to my GitHub page where I store my code! 

I am a physics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. 

More info about me can be found at [zch.info](www.zch.info).

## Projects

Currently, I am splitting my time between four projects:
```
 Develop a method for improving optical cluster cosmology with multi-wavelength data.
 
 Find star-forming clumps in hydrodynamic simulations.
 
 Help simulate the Dark Energy Survey image for Y6 shear pipeline.
 
 Finish up a paper on the intrinsic alignment in galaxy clusters.
```
