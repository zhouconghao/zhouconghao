<h1> Hi! Zhou here! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>


Welcome to my GitHub page where I store my code! 

I am a physics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. 

More info about me can be found at [zch.info](www.zch.info).

## Projects

Currently, I am splitting my time between four projects:
```
 Develop a method for improving optical cluster cosmology with multi-wavelength data.

 Study the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation in Illustris TNG.

 Measure the shear response clustering bias in cosmic shear. 
 
 
```
