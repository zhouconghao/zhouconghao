## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page where I store my code. I am physics graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. More info about me can be found at [zch.info](www.zch.info).

### Projects

Currently, I am splitting my time between three projects:

- Develop a method for measuring cluster selection effect bias in large optical surveys.
- Find star forming clumps in hydrodynamic simulations.
- Help with DES Y6 image simulation for shear pipeline.
